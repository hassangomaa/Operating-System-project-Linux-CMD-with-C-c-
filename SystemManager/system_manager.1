To set the date or number of days (since January 1, 1970) when the password was last changed, use the -d flag as follows.

# chage -d 2018-02-11 ravi
Next, you can also set the date or number of days (since January 1, 1970) on which the user’s account will no longer be accessible by using the -E switch as shown in the following command.

In this case, once a user’s account is locked, he/she is required to contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again.

# chage -E 2018-02-16 ravi
Then, the -W option allows you to set the number of days of warning before a password change is required. Considering the command below, the user ravi will be warned 10 days prior to his password expiring.

# chage -W 10 ravi
In addition, you can set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired before the account is locked. This example means that after user ravi’s password expires, his account will be inactive for 2 days before it is locked.

When the account becomes inactive, he must contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again.

# chage -I 2 ravi
